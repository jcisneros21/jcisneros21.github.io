Dems need to start throwing this word at every republican they see, now, so it dovetails perfectly with the inevitable impeachment proceedings where it becomes clear that Trump and company betrayed the country, and every single one of these republican enablers is right there with him.",

I know people who loved Trump, I know people who loved Bernie, I even know people who loved Gary Johnson; however, while I know many who *voted* for Hillary, none of them liked her in the least. They just hated Trump more.",

              "No need to yet. You should still contact your representative to voice your opinion. They do keep track of that information and have ways of correlating that number to votes. This bill will probably pass the house and die in the senate. The bill is generic politics at its best. The house is just trying to get something through so they can pass the buck to the senate where the bill will die. This allows Ryan to say they tried but the senate stopped them. It gives Trump fuel to point the finger at the democrats for not crossing the party lines to make the bill better.",
              "Most of us voted Hillary. She won the popular vote by a decent margin.  It's the convoluted electoral college system that got Trump into the White House. (And some might argue it's the DNC's fault for throwing Bernie under the bus. I don't know anything about that though.) ",
              "America DIDNT vote for him. Trump lost the popular vote, and still got in because of an outdated, rigged system. If our government were really up to us, this would have never happened.",

The sad thing is that my dad is a hardcore trump supporter and ...I kind of want to ask him this question, but I am afraid of what his response would be. ",
              "It's propaganda.  Okay let me try to explain this. I'm not sure what the #1 station over in Australia is but everyone likes BBC so I'll use that.  In the late 90's, the FCC removed this thing called the fairness doctrine. What this doctrine did was require that network news channels devote equal time to both conservative and liberal viewpoints. At the time, CNN and FoxNews were the big cable news providers. The head of foxnews saw an opportunity to profit off of what people perceive to be a liberal media by making fox a conservative station. So little by little, through the millennia and the 2000's, fox moved more and more to the right, devoting more and more time to conservative viewpoints and less on liberal.  By the time Obama was elected, fox was the de facto mouthpiece of the Republican Party. They were the original fake news and actually did distort reality and flat out lie. Their viewers, being old people who have watched them for years and not notice the shift, ate it up. Ratings increased so they moved even more right.  My point is that stations like fox repeat over and over with so-called \"experts\" how universal healthcare is baaaaad blah blah obama devil. Their audience eats it up. This alt-right parallel universe of falsehoods is how trump got elected. Because the far right spread rumors that Hillary was eating children pizza or something.  There's also this effect called the Oppenheimer Window. It's where extreme changes become more tolerable due to gradual shifts in public perception. ",
              "My parents support Trump, but they aren't hardcore republicans. I talked to my mom about the pre-existing condition issue yesterday and she was all \"what? No, Trump said that wouldn't happen\". ",
              "> believe rape should be considered a pre-existing condition???? As someone else pointed it out: > it's not the rape that's the pre-existing condition, it's the HIV treatment drugs that you're given after the rape that count as a the pre-existing condition. So hopefully nobody thinks rape is a pre-existing condition. But sadly you get a lot of Trump supporters who think things like this. I agree with Trump on a lot of things, but some of his supporters and ideas are just wrong. This especially annoys me because my mum has had 6 c-sections. If we lived in the US and this was the healthcare she had to deal with it would have cost her a fortune.",
