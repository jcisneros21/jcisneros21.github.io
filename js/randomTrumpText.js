They know that allowing NK to further escalate nuclear tensions would probably result in a big US military presence in the Korean Peninsula and China really doesn't want that.      My concern is: will Trump act like a decent statesman and President (for once) and work WITH our allies instead of just throwing Twitter temper tantrums? ",

              "I know we're joking but I bought in on infastructure and construction industry. As well as fossil fuels. I have doubts Trump will be able to go through on his campaign promises with these industries. But the market speculation has been enough to post decent gains.",

They typically are seen in packs of 10-20 so a shot like this is exceptionally rare, the OP is fortunate to have captured it. Due to their superior intelligence, a typical pack is smarter than the entire Trump administration. Biologists believe they make their own bandannas. Edit: typo",

The statement \"only animals capable of\" is not what the linked article states, nor is there any definitive evidence they are the only species with such capabilities... This is what Trump does - exaggerates a claim beyond the truth of what is actually known. Why don't you correct your false statement? ",
              "We keep voting republican and they keep making more power for cops. Trump plans to remove as much police over sight as he can and he's quite proud of that. There are many causes but if one is looking for something simple they can do it's never ever vote republican.",

But after months of sucker punching  trump supporters, patriots, veterans, liberals, etc these people ACTUALLY HAS TO BRING HELMETS AND ARMOR AT A FREE SPEECH RALLY IN AMERICA to defend themselves. The other day when Ann Coulter got cancelled in Berkeley, hundreds of people showed up to defend free speech and Antifa didn't show up. And guess what? No violence! ",

              "In negotiations, it's best if your opponent underestimates you. The fact that so many people think Trump is an idiot means that he has everyone right where he wants them. Don't believe me? Do a YouTube search for Trump addressing Congress in 1996, where *he* explains their own tax laws back to them.  The man is way smarter than most give him credit for.",
              "So the Trump supporters there claim that ANTIFA are funded by George Soros. Since ANTIFA bought the bagels, the logic goes that Soros bought the bagels. I personally think between the \"Soros bagels off our streets\" and \"America was never great\" chants I'd have to go with the Trumpets. They seem to be pretty passionately against littering, and the other, y'know, disrespects the nation I live in and my family serves.",
              "I don't think Trump is the same man he was back in 1996.  Age is not always kind.",
              "This is why I've disliked people calling Trump a \"Nazi\" throughout this election cycle. All that calling the alt-right and Trumpians \"Nazis\" does is dillute the meaning of the word. And then we get to where we are now, where nobody is actually sure what the word even means: people who have right-leaning political views are labeled wrongfully as \"fascist,\" and actual Nazis end up getting the benefit of the doubt because so many are being falsely accused.",

              "While I agree somewhat to their political views, they are going about it the wrong way. If Trump and Sessions are so dead against abortion and drugs then why aren't they mandating things like easier to access birth control to reduce the number of abortions, and harm reduction strategies for resolving the drug problem. Their current strategy of prohibition and chauvinistic attitude towards women is pretty disturbing. And I bet both Trump and Sessions would be more than happy to uphold horribly cruel things like infant circumcision. These are leading the country. We want leaders who at least care somewhat about basic human rights but they don't seem to care from my own admittedly limited perspective of their political positions.",
              "Well Trump did make a big deal about \"Loyalty Day\" yesterday.  And yes, I know it has been around since 1921 but this is the first time I can recall a President in the last two decades making a big fuss about it.",

              "What do you think about American healthcare and healthcare in other countries like, say, european ones? Some people say that healthcare is dumb because you pay taxes for it and may never need it. On the other hand, people who get fucked and -really- need to get treated for something serious don't need to worry about it.  What's your opinion? Which is better?  Thoughts on Obamacare and Trump removing it without replacing it with something better like he promised?",
